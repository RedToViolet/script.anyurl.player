AnyURL Player, the script to integrate Firefox/Chrome with Kodi.

To install the browser extension you need [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), 
or [TamperMonkey for Chrome](http://tampermonkey.net/). 
Then just click on [this link](https://github.com/VioletRed/script.anyurl.player/raw/master/json/Play_on_XBMC.user.js) 
to start the script installation.

It works stand-alone, but some features require the companion plugin. You can download latest 
[script.anyurl.player-X.Y.Z.zip from the releases page](https://github.com/VioletRed/script.anyurl.player/releases/latest)
(current is 1.2.2), and install it following [the instructions in Kodi's wiki](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file).
